 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 .
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
 creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
 provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
 improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any
 reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and
 derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
 license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
 does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 Font Software refers to the set of files released by the
 Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.
 This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 Reserved Font Name refers to any names specified as such after
 the copyright statement(s).
 .
 Original Version refers to the collection of Font Software
 components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 Modified Version refers to any derivative made by adding to,
 deleting, or substituting in part or in whole any of the components
 of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font
 Software to a new environment.
 .
 Author refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .

 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the
    Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise

    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to

AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright
.
The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now freely
available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
cooperation
of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&Y.
Members of this consortium include:
.
Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)
.
In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
held by
the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
given a different name.

UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
-------------------------------
.
PREAMBLE
This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
the fonts.
.
DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.
.
"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as received under this licence.
.
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
a new environment.
.
"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
copyright ownership of the Font Software.
.
"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
.
To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.
.
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
rights are reserved.
.
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
the below conditions:
.
1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.
.
2) The font name complies with the following:
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
the new work, appended to that name.
.
3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
their explicit written permission.
.
4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
licence.
.
TERMINATION
This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
